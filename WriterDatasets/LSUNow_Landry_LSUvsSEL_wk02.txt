Starting left tackle Saahdiq Charles and outside linebacker Michael Divinity will not dress out for LSU's season opener against Southeastern Louisiana. 

Nola.com's Bordy Miller reported that both players are serving one game suspensions. 

Sophomore Austin Deculus was taking first team reps at left tackle during warmups and is expected to start in Charles' position. LSU's offensive line already took a hit in the season opener, when right tackle Adrian Magee went out with a knee injury. 

Andre Anthony will likely start at Buck linebacker in place of the injured K'Lavon Chaisson, while Ray Thornton will start at F linebacker in place of Divinty.
