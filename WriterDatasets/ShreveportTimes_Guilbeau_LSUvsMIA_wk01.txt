Quarterback Joe Burrow, a graduate transfer from Ohio State who chose Orgeron and LSU over nearby Cincinnati last spring, may finally be the above average or better quarterback LSU has been searching for since Zach Metteberger left after the 2013 season.

Burrow completed 11 of 24 passes for 140 yards with no interceptions and added athletic rushes of 11 and five yards in directing the No. 24 Tigers to a stunning domination of No. 8 Miami, 33-17, in front of 68,841 at AT&T Stadium. Miami was the highest ranked team to fall to LSU since No. 8 Florida lost, 35-28, in 2015.

It wasn't all about the numbers for Burrow. It was that Burrow refreshingly just looked like a field general out there. He did not set the world on fire. Do not get the wrong idea. But Burrow at least looked like he belonged out there. He called audibles frequently, and he looked like LSU's most athletic quarterback since Matt Flynn in 2007. Burrow can throw and run, and he can throw on the run.

Orgeron's transfer tentacles also managed to matriculate as far as Worcester, Massachusetts, with the help of new special teams coordinator Greg McMahon to sign another transfer recruit ? senior kicker Cole Tracy of Assumption College. Orgeron got sick of missed field goals last season, as Jack Gonsoulin and Connor Culp managed to miss 11 of 27, including three misses in seven tries from between 20 and 29 yards and another four misses out of 11 tries from between 30 and 39 yards.

All Tracy on this night did was tie LSU's record for longest field goal that had not been matched in 22 years. He booted a 54-yard bomb for a 33-3 lead in the third quarter. It was LSU's longest field goal since Wade Richey's 54-yard kick against Kentucky in 1996. Ronnie Lewis set the record in 1985 against North Carolina at 54 yards. Tracy kicked four field goals in four tries in all from various distances ? 21 yards twice and 43 yards. He didn't miss, and he was performing in front of only 66,000 more than the average attendance at Assumption over his previous three seasons, which was 2,026. 

Burrow and Tracy were not the only new faces contributing to what was Orgeron's finest victory as LSU's coach, based on the opponent's ranking. His previous highest-ranked victim was No. 10 Auburn, 27-23, last season. And suddenly that game on Sept. 22 at Auburn - where LSU has won just twice this century - is not looking like an automatic LSU loss as so many of us have said ... and written.

New starters Nick Brossette at tailback, sophomore Jacob Phillips at middle linebacker and sophomore Justin Jefferson at wide receiver played major roles. Orgeron recruited and signed the latter two. He didn't recruit or sign Brossette, but he gave the patient senior the chance he has been waiting for since he arrived in 2015 out of University High on the LSU campus. A second chance, that is.

Orgeron partially blamed then-offensive coordinator Matt Canada ? now 1-0 as Maryland's head coach with a win Saturday over Texas ? for the Troy loss last season. This was because Canada started Brossette instead of No. 2 tailback Darrel Williams with Derrius Guice hurt, and Canada didn't tell Orgeron. And Brossette fumbled on LSU's first play of the game. 

Brossette did not fumble on this night. On his second carry of the game, he busted a 50-yard run off guard for a touchdown and 10-3 lead that broke up a sluggish game with 35 seconds to go in the first quarter. And LSU was off to a brighter 2018.

The crafty Burrow, by the way, changed what was a second-and-15 pass play to this Brossette run before the snap because Burrow saw a Miami safety move from the middle of the field to the outside, showing a blitz. The middle was open, and Brossette was gone. 

Miami was barely heard from again. Its best moment may have been a minor pregame skirmish of pushing and jawing that was quickly extinguished.

Brossette went over 100 yards for the first time in his college career in the third quarter and finished with 125 yards on 22 carries with two touchdowns. Jefferson caught five passes for 81 yards. Phillips put the game on ice with a 45-yard tipped interception return for a 27-3 lead with 4:21 to go in the first half.

Another Orgeron recruit - true freshman wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase ? set up Brossette's 1-yard touchdown run for a 17-3 lead in the second quarter with a 22-yard catch of a Burrow pass to the 1-yard line. Jefferson caught a 37-yard pass from Burrow to set up a Tracy field goal and 20-3 lead in the second quarter.

Burrow completed 8 of 16 passes for 101 yards and had a nice, 5-yard scramble in the first half. He was 10 of 22 for 133 yards through three quarters.

LSU totaled 181 yards on 37 plays to 156 on 27 plays by the Hurricanes at the half before finishing with 342 yards to 296.

Brossette got good blocks from new starting center Lloyd Cushenberry and from senior left guard Garrett Brumfield on the 50-yard jaunt.

The Tigers extended that to 17-3 with a 58-yard drive in 11 plays. LSU and Burrow converted two fourth downs on that drive. On fourth and one from the Miami 49, Brossette gained two yards. Then on fourth and one from the Miami 38, Miami was offsides. Burrow also set up a Tracy field goal for a 20-3 lead in the second quarter with a 37-yard completion to Jefferson, who had three catches for 51 yards in the first half.

Miami finally reached the end zone with 13:57 to go in the game on a 3-yard run by quarterback Malik Rosier, cutting the Tigers' lead to 33-10 after the extra point. The Hurricanes added another meaningless touchdown with 8:43 to play on a 32-yard pass from Rosier to Brian Hightower for the final.

Meaningless scores with half a quarter to play. No one ? not even LSU's most ardent fans ? foresaw such domination by LSU.

In the end, it was one of Orgeron's finest hours as he improved to 7-0 in a sweet statistical category.

With the win over Miami, Orgeron went to 7-0 as LSU's head coach against schools where he formerly coached, beginning in 2016 when he was interim head coach through seven games of the regular season with the Tigers.

Those victories were against Ole Miss, where he was head coach from 2005-07, in 2016 and '17, Arkansas, where he was an assistant strength coach from 1986-87, in 2016 and '17, Syracuse, where he coached the defensive line from 1995-97, in 2017, Tennessee, where he coached the defensive line and was recruiting coordinator in 2009, in 2017, and Miami, where he coached the defensive line from 1989-92, in 2018.

That's how you start a season. 

A fresh one with fresh faces everywhere. 

INJURY REPORT: The first quarter was costly for the Tigers as three players left the game with injuries ? starting right tackle Adrian Magee, cornerback Andraez "Greedy" Williams and safety John Battle. Williams and Battle returned. Magee did not, and it appeared his leg was rolled over.

"It looked pretty severe," Orgeron said. 

Outside linebacker K'Lavon Chaisson left the game late in the fourth quarter with what appeared to be a knee injury. He walked off on his own, but with a limp.
